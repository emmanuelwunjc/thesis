Step	Description	Sample Size	Exclusion Criteria	Remaining Observations
1	Full HINTS 7 Sample	7,278	None (original dataset)	7,278
2	Merge with Privacy Index	7,278	Missing HHID or privacy index data	~7,200
3	Filter WillingShareData_HCP2	~7,200	Exclude "Inapplicable", "Commission Error", and other non-Yes/No responses	2,662
4	Remove Missing Key Variables	2,662	Missing values in: diabetic, privacy_caution_index, age, education	2,421
5	Final Regression Analysis Sample	2,421	Complete cases for all regression variables	2,421

Detailed Exclusion Information:
Step 1: Original HINTS 7 Public Dataset (2022) with 7,278 adults aged 18 and older
Step 2: Inner join with privacy caution index data (some observations may not have privacy index calculated)
Step 3: Keep only valid responses to data sharing willingness question (Yes=1, No=0)
  - Excluded: "Inapplicable, coded 2 in WearableDevTrackHealth2" (3,849 cases, 52.9%)
  - Excluded: "Question answered in error (Commission Error)" (652 cases, 9.0%)
  - Excluded: Various missing data codes (115 cases, 1.6%)
  - Kept: Yes responses (2,026 cases, 26.8%) and No responses (636 cases, 8.4%)
Step 4: Remove observations with missing values in key independent variables (diabetic, privacy_caution_index, age, education, region, etc.)
Step 5: Final sample for regression analysis with complete data for all variables

Final Sample Characteristics:
- Total observations: 2,421
- Diabetic patients: ~510 (21.1% of final sample)
- Non-diabetic patients: ~1,911 (78.9% of final sample)
- Mean age: 58.3 years
- Gender: Female 52.1%, Male 47.9%
