### Abstract

Digital health technologies generate vast amounts of personal data, but willingness to share such information varies significantly across populations. This study examines how privacy caution, digital engagement, and diabetes status jointly influence adults' willingness to share health information. Using nationally representative data from HINTS 7 (N=2,421), we analyze whether the relationship between privacy attitudes and data sharing differs for adults with and without diabetes. Logistic regression models reveal that privacy caution is the strongest predictor of unwillingness to share health data (β = −2.44, p < 0.001). While diabetes status alone does not significantly predict sharing behavior, the interaction between diabetes and privacy caution is significant and positive (β = 0.49, p = 0.038), indicating that privacy concerns have a weaker negative effect among adults with diabetes. Age is positively associated with sharing willingness, while education shows no significant relationship. These findings suggest that chronic disease management contexts may modify how individuals weigh privacy risks against perceived benefits of data sharing. The results contribute to ongoing policy discussions about health data governance by demonstrating that privacy attitudes operate differently across health conditions. Understanding these behavioral patterns is essential for designing consent processes, privacy-enhancing technologies, and governance models that maintain trust while enabling equitable participation in digital health systems.
